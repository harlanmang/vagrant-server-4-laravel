# Vagrant Server for Laravel 5.6 

This should be everything needed to get the dev server up. If anything else is found, please add an issue or document the commit.

## Setup Project

After the initial vagrant up you need to setup your project.

### Automated Project Setup
SSH into the server

Store your GitHub Credentials on the server

Run `setup-project.sh`

## Complete Setup
Back on your local machine, in the `www` folder do a npm install

```
# npm install
```

#### Note

Any problems or suggestions please document. I'd like to come up with a more streamlined process to get a new project up.
